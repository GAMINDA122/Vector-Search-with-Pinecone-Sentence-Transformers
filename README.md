🧠 Vector Search with Pinecone and Sentence Transformers<br>
This project demonstrates how to build a semantic similarity search system using Pinecone Vector Database and Hugging Face Sentence Transformers. It allows you to store, update, query, and manage vector embeddings efficiently with real-world text data.

🚀 Project Overview<br>
This Python project includes:<br>
  - ✅ Creating a Pinecone index (cosine metric)<br>
  - ✅ Converting text into 768-dimension vector embeddings using all-mpnet-base-v2<br>
  - ✅ Upserting documents into Pinecone with metadata<br>
  - ✅ Running similarity search queries<br>
  - ✅ Performing full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)<br>
  - ✅ Deleting the index after use<br>

📂 Use Case<br>
The following topics are used for embedding and similarity comparison:<br>
  - 🌍 Geography<br>
  - 🧠 Mental Health<br>
  - 🚀 Elon Musk<br>
  - 🎭 Culture<br>
  - 🗳️ Politics (newly added later)<br>
 -  🇱🇰 Sri Lanka Geography (as an update example)<br>

🛠️ Technologies Used<br>
  - 🐍 Python<br>
  - 🤗 sentence-transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2)<br>
  - 🌲 Pinecone Vector DB<br>
  -  Jupyter Notebook (for code + demo)<br>
	
📦 Installation<br>
```bash
  pip install sentence-transformers pinecone-client
```
  
🧪 How to Use<br>
  - Set up your Pinecone API key<br>
  - Encode your documents using Sentence Transformers<br>
  - Upsert vectors into the Pinecone index<br>
  - Perform similarity search using query embeddings<br>
  - Update, read, or delete entries as needed<br>
  - Optionally delete the entire index when finished<br>
