🧠 Vector Search with Pinecone and Sentence Transformers
This project demonstrates how to build a semantic similarity search system using Pinecone Vector Database and Hugging Face Sentence Transformers. It allows you to store, update, query, and manage vector embeddings efficiently with real-world text data.

🚀 Project Overview
This Python project includes:
  ✅ Creating a Pinecone index (cosine metric)
  ✅ Converting text into 768-dimension vector embeddings using all-mpnet-base-v2
  ✅ Upserting documents into Pinecone with metadata
  ✅ Running similarity search queries
  ✅ Performing full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  ✅ Deleting the index after use

📂 Use Case
The following topics are used for embedding and similarity comparison:
  🌍 Geography
  🧠 Mental Health
  🚀 Elon Musk
  🎭 Culture
  🗳️ Politics (newly added later)
  🇱🇰 Sri Lanka Geography (as an update example)

🛠️ Technologies Used
  🐍 Python
  🤗 sentence-transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2)
  🌲 Pinecone Vector DB
  Jupyter Notebook (for code + demo)
📦 Installation
  pip install sentence-transformers pinecone-client
  
🧪 How to Use
  Set up your Pinecone API key
  Encode your documents using Sentence Transformers
  Upsert vectors into the Pinecone index
  Perform similarity search using query embeddings
  Update, read, or delete entries as needed
  Optionally delete the entire index when finished
